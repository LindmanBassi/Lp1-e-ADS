### Step 1: Set Up Your React Project

1. **Install Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Create a New React App**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to create a new React application:

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app create-account-app
   ```

3. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd create-account-app
   ```

### Step 2: Install Required Packages

You may want to install additional packages for form handling and routing. For this example, we will use `react-router-dom` for routing:

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

### Step 3: Create the "Create Account" Component

1. **Create a New Folder for Components**:

   Inside the `src` directory, create a folder named `components`:

   ```bash
   mkdir src/components
   ```

2. **Create the CreateAccount Component**:

   Create a new file named `CreateAccount.js` inside the `components` folder:

   ```javascript
   // src/components/CreateAccount.js
   import React, { useState } from 'react';

   const CreateAccount = () => {
       const [username, setUsername] = useState('');
       const [password, setPassword] = useState('');
       const [email, setEmail] = useState('');

       const handleSubmit = (e) => {
           e.preventDefault();
           // Here you would typically send the data to your backend
           console.log('Account Created:', { username, password, email });
       };

       return (
           <div>
               <h2>Create Account</h2>
               <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
                   <div>
                       <label>Username:</label>
                       <input
                           type="text"
                           value={username}
                           onChange={(e) => setUsername(e.target.value)}
                           required
                       />
                   </div>
                   <div>
                       <label>Password:</label>
                       <input
                           type="password"
                           value={password}
                           onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}
                           required
                       />
                   </div>
                   <div>
                       <label>Email:</label>
                       <input
                           type="email"
                           value={email}
                           onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
                           required
                       />
                   </div>
                   <button type="submit">Create Account</button>
               </form>
           </div>
       );
   };

   export default CreateAccount;
   ```

### Step 4: Set Up Routing

1. **Modify `App.js` to Include Routing**:

   Open `src/App.js` and modify it to include the `CreateAccount` component:

   ```javascript
   // src/App.js
   import React from 'react';
   import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
   import CreateAccount from './components/CreateAccount';

   const App = () => {
       return (
           <Router>
               <div>
                   <Switch>
                       <Route path="/create-account" component={CreateAccount} />
                       <Route path="/" exact>
                           <h1>Welcome to the App</h1>
                           <a href="/create-account">Create Account</a>
                       </Route>
                   </Switch>
               </div>
           </Router>
       );
   };

   export default App;
   ```

### Step 5: Run Your Application

1. **Start the Development Server**:

   In your terminal, run:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Open Your Browser**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see your application in action.

### Step 6: Test the Create Account Feature

- Click on the "Create Account" link to navigate to the create account form.
- Fill in the form and submit it. You should see the account details logged in the console.

### Additional Considerations

- **Backend Integration**: To make this feature functional, you would need to set up a backend service (like the Spring Boot application you mentioned) to handle account creation and store user data in a database.
- **Form Validation**: Consider adding form validation to improve user experience.
- **Styling**: You can use CSS or libraries like Bootstrap to style your form.

This setup provides a basic structure for a React application with a "Create Account" feature. You can expand upon this by adding more features and improving the UI/UX as needed.
